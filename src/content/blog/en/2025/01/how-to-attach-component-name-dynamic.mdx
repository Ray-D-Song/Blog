description: 'This article shares a method to dynamically attach component name (option name) in Vue to solve the KeepAlive limit (caching components based on component name).'

## Problem
The cache component `KeepAlive` in Vue uses the component name (option name) as the cache key.  
There are two ways to define name in Vue:
```vue
<script setup>
{/* define name in setup */}
defineOptions({
  name: 'MyComponent'
})
</script>

<script>
{/* define name in script */}
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent'
}
</script>
```
But both ways are static, and cannot dynamically bind the component name.  
For example, if you want to dynamically specify the name based on the route parameters, you will get an error:
```vue
<script setup>
const route = useRoute()
defineOptions({
  name: route.params.name
})
</script>
```

```bash
 Ã— ModuleError: [@vue/compiler-sfc] `defineOptions()` in <script setup> cannot reference locally declared variables because it will be hoisted outside of the setup() function.
```
This error means that defineOptions will be hoisted outside of the setup() function, so it cannot access route.params.name.  

<strong>If multiple pages use the same Page component, they will either be cached or not cached.</strong>  
This behavior is definitely not what we want.  

## Solution
The solution is to wrap the component again.  
Define a function that returns the wrapped component through the function parameters.  

```ts
import type { Component } from 'vue'

function createPage(name: string, component: Component) {
  return {
    // component name
    name,
    data () {
      return { component: null }
    },
    async created () {
      if (component instanceof Promise) {
        try {
          const module = await component
          this.component = module?.default
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`can not resolve component ${name}, error:`, error)
        }

        return
      }
      this.component = component
    },
    render () {
      return this.component ? h(this.component) : null
    },
  }
}
```
This function receives two parameters: the component name and the component itself.  
This way, we can dynamically specify the component name based on different parameters.
