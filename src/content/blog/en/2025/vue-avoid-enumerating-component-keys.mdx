## Problem Description
When packaging a Vue project and running it in the browser, the following warning occurs:
```bash
[Vue warn]: Avoid app logic that relies on enumerating keys on a component instance.
```

## Problem Cause
This warning means: Avoid enumerating keys on a component instance.  
Vue allows enumerating keys on a component instance in the development environment through methods like `for` or `Object.keys`, but not in the production environment.  

The abstract part is that when this warning occurs, the warn trace does not provide specific code line numbers, but instead indicates the `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js` file.  
The reason for this warning is also very strange, and it is not necessarily that there is actually an enumeration of keys on a component instance in the code.  

## Possible Causes and Solutions
### `vue-devtools` Debugging Tool Bug
Vue Devtools listens to component instances, causing this issue. You can first uninstall `vue-devtools` to determine if the tool is the cause.  
Upgrading `vue-devtools` or the Vue version (maybe) can solve the problem.  

### `watch` Watched route object
```javascript
const route = useRoute()
/**
 * Watched the entire route object
 * watch is default deep reactive, triggering this warning
 */
watch(() => route, () => {
  // ...
})

// Modify to watch specific route properties
watch(() => route.path, () => {
  // ...
})

// Or use the default non-deep reactive watchEffect
watchEffect(() => {
  console.log(route.path)
})
```

### Passing the entire to object in the route guard
```javascript
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  addTab(to)
})
```
This is the actual situation I encountered, where the entire to object was passed in the route guard, including the `component` property, causing this warning.  
The correct approach is to pass only the properties of the to object that are needed.  
```javascript
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  addTab(to.path)
})
```
