## What is WebDAV
Simple speaking, WebDAV is a file system based on HTTP protocol, which can be mounted like a local file system.

## Deploy
There are many open-source WebDAV services, I use the Go-written [webdav](https://github.com/hacdias/webdav).  
The advantage is that it is easy to use, just download the compiled binary file, and run it.  

On the [Releases](https://github.com/hacdias/webdav/releases) page, download the binary file for the corresponding platform, and then execute the following operations:  
```bash
tar -zxvf webdav-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

The following files are included in the decompressed file:
- `webdav` binary file
- `LICENSE` license file
- `README.md` description file

### Configuration
Create a `config.yml` file in the directory where `webdav` is located, with the following reference configuration:  
```yml
address: 0.0.0.0
port: 6065

# TLS-related settings if you want to enable TLS directly.
tls: false
cert: cert.pem
key: key.pem

# Prefix to apply to the WebDAV path-ing. Default is '/'.
prefix: /

# Enable or disable debug logging. Default is 'false'.
debug: false

# Disable sniffing the files to detect their content type. Default is 'false'.
noSniff: false

# Whether the server runs behind a trusted proxy or not. When this is true,
# the header X-Forwarded-For will be used for logging the remote addresses
# of logging attempts (if available).
behindProxy: false

# The directory that will be able to be accessed by the users when connecting.
# This directory will be used by users unless they have their own 'directory' defined.
# Default is '.' (current directory).
directory: .

# [!code highlight:5]
# The default permissions for users. This is a case insensitive option. Possible
# permissions: C (Create), R (Read), U (Update), D (Delete). You can combine multiple
# permissions. For example, to allow to read and create, set "RC". Default is "R".
permissions: R

# The default permissions rules for users. Default is none. Rules are applied
# from last to first, that is, the first rule that matches the request, starting
# from the end, will be applied to the request.
rules: []

# The behavior of redefining the rules for users. It can be:
# - overwrite: when a user has rules defined, these will overwrite any global
#   rules already defined. That is, the global rules are not applicable to the
#   user.
# - append: when a user has rules defined, these will be appended to the global
#   rules already defined. That is, for this user, their own specific rules will
#   be checked first, and then the global rules.
# Default is 'overwrite'.
rulesBehavior: overwrite

# Logging configuration
log:
  # Logging format ('console', 'json'). Default is 'console'.
  format: console
  # Enable or disable colors. Default is 'true'. Only applied if format is 'console'.
  colors: true
  # Logging outputs. You can have more than one output. Default is only 'stderr'.
  outputs:
  - stderr

# CORS configuration
cors:
  # Whether or not CORS configuration should be applied. Default is 'false'.
  enabled: true
  credentials: true
  allowed_headers:
    - Depth
  allowed_hosts:
    - http://localhost:8080
  allowed_methods:
    - GET
  exposed_headers:
    - Content-Length
    - Content-Range

# [!code highlight:18]
# The list of users. If the list is empty, then there will be no authentication.
# Otherwise, basic authentication will automatically be configured.
#
# If you're delegating the authentication to a different service, you can proxy
# the username using basic authentication, and then disable webdav's password
# check using the option:
#
# noPassword: true
users:
  # Example 'admin' user with plaintext password.
  - username: admin
    password: admin
  # Example 'john' user with bcrypt encrypted password, with custom directory.
  - username: john
    password: "{bcrypt}$2y$10$zEP6oofmXFeHaeMfBNLnP.DO8m.H.Mwhd24/TOX2MWLxAExXi4qgi"
    directory: /another/path
  # Example user whose details will be picked up from the environment.
  - username: "{env}ENV_USERNAME"
    password: "{env}ENV_PASSWORD"
  - username: basic
    password: basic
    # Override default permissions.
    permissions: CRUD
    rules:
      # With this rule, the user CANNOT access /some/files.
      - path: /some/file
        permissions: none
      # With this rule, the user CAN create, read, update and delete within /public/access.
      - path: /public/access/
        permissions: CRUD
      # With this rule, the user CAN read and update all files ending with .js. It uses
      # a regular expression.
      - regex: "^.+.js$"
        permissions: RU
```

### Start
```bash
# Directly run
./webdav

# Background run
./webdav &
```

WebDAV service will automatically read the `config.yml` file in the same directory, and the default data directory is the current directory.  

### Set to start automatically on boot
```bash
# Create a systemd service file
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/webdav.service
```
Configuration file content:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=WebDAV

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/webdav
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable service:  
Remember to replace `/path/to/webdav` with the actual path.
```bash
sudo systemctl enable webdav.service
sudo systemctl start webdav.service
```

### nginx reverse proxy and https configuration
If you are not familiar with nginx, you can refer to my [nginx configuration HTTPS tutorial](/en/blog/nginx-config-https).  

Add a new server configuration in the nginx configuration, as follows:  
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    # [!code highlight:5]
    server_name your_domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your_certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your_private_key.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6065; # [!code highlight]
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
The important highlighted lines:
- `your_domain.com` replace with your domain name
- `/path/to/your_certificate.crt` replace with your certificate path
- `/path/to/your_private_key.key` replace with your private key path
- `http://localhost:6065` replace with your service address

Save the configuration file and restart the Nginx service.  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Usage
There are many ways to use WebDAV, here I introduce using the Mac default Finder client to use WebDAV.  
In Finder, select `Go` -> `Connect to Server`, enter your domain name and port, then enter the username and password, and you can use WebDAV like a local file system.  

If you add, modify, or delete and prompt insufficient permissions, please check the highlighted lines in your configuration file, ensuring that the user has the corresponding permissions.
