When using Vueuse, I found a very useful method [until](https://vueuse.org/shared/until/).

The method is used to monitor a reactive variable, and block the current method until the variable meets the requirements.

The call form is as follows:

```ts
// will be resolve until ref.value === true or 1000ms passed
await until(ref).toBe(true, { timeout: 1000 })
```

This method can solve many engineering problems, such as in the double token scheme, the user triggers multiple requests at once, and the refreshToken method is executed in the first request.
After the refreshToken is successful, the subsequent requests should continue to be executed.
To achieve this effect, there are two solutions. One is to set the subsequent requests to the callback and store them in an array.
However, this will involve parameter passing and scope issues.
The better method is to use the util method, check whether the current status is blocked before each fetch, and block until the refresh is complete.

Call form like this:
```ts
const status = reactive('idle')

async function fetcher() {
  await util(status, 'idle')

  // ...

  if (res.status === 401) {
    // 401 unauthorized, block other requests
    status.value = 'blocked'
    await refreshToken()
    // refresh success, change status
    status.value = 'idele'
  }
}
```

I hope to implement a framework-independent util method, to achieve a simple value monitoring effect.
Because util is a blocking operation, it should return a Promise.
```ts
function util(reactive: unknown, targetValue: unknown) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    // until reactive value equals targetValue, then resolve
  })
}
```
The problem is, JavaScript does not contain the `until` semantic or API, but we can monitor the change of the reactive value, and execute the resolve callback when the value changes.

In order to implement this method, we can refer to Vue, the core of `@vue/reactivity` is based on Proxy.
First, write a reactive wrapper function, receive the initial value, and return a proxy object:
```ts
function reactive<T>(value: T): Reactive<T> {
  const proxyed = new Proxy({ value }, {
    set(target, prop, newValue) {
      target[prop as keyof typeof target] = newValue
      return true
    }
  })
  return proxyed
}
```
When the value of the proxy object is changed, the set method will be triggered, and the resolve callback will be executed.
Next, we need to store the resolve callback in a bucket, and execute it when the value changes.
We can use WeakMap to store the callback:
```ts
const effectMap = new WeakMap<object, Array<() => void>>()
```
Write the callback function into the bucket in the util function:
```ts
function util<T>(reactive: Reactive<T>, targetValue: unknown) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    // if the initial value is the same as the target value, resolve directly
    if (reactive.value === targetValue) {
      resolve(true)
      return
    }
    // get the existing callback
    const cbs = effectMap.get(reactive) || []
    // write the new callback
    cbs.push(() => {
      // when the value equals the target value, resolve
      if (reactive.value === targetValue) {
        resolve(true)
      }
    })
  })
}
```

Next, we need to trigger the callback when the value of the proxy object changes.
We can modify the set method of the proxy object:
```ts
const proxyed = new Proxy({ value }, {
  set(target, prop, newValue) {
    target[prop as keyof typeof target] = newValue
    const cbs = effectMap.get(proxyed)
    if (cbs) cbs.forEach(cb => cb())
    return true
  }
})
```
