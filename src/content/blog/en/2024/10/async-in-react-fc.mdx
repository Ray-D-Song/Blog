I've been a Vue user for a long time, and I've just started using React recently. I hope the following content can help those who are as confused as I was about functional components.

## Suspense
First, the following syntax is invalid in React:
```tsx
async function Child() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  
  return <div>{data}</div>
}

function Parent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>loading</div>}>
      <Child />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

This is the first misconception. In Vue, you can use `<Suspense>` to wrap the child component and use `await` at the top level of the child component. However, in React, each component is a synchronous component, and `<Suspense>` only supports the following situations:

* Frameworks that support Suspense, such as Relay and Next.js.
* Using lazy to load component code.
* Using `use` to read the value of a Promise.

Among them, `use API` can achieve a similar effect to `await` at the top level in Vue, but it is still in the experimental stage.

## Correct way

### useEffect
```tsx
function AsyncComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      const result = await someAsyncOperation()
      setData(result)
    }
    fetchData()
  }, [])

  if (!data) return <div>loading</div>
  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```
If the `useEffect` hook's second parameter is an empty array, it will execute the Effect function when the component is first rendered.  
In the above example, it will execute `fetchData` when the component is first rendered. After the request is successful, it will use `setData` to update the data and refresh the view.  

> Note: The second parameter of `useEffect` cannot be omitted, otherwise it will trigger an infinite refresh.

### Custom hooks
Each request is written like this, making the component's expression very verbose.  
The common way is to encapsulate the request into a custom hook.

```tsx
function useAsyncData() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const result = await someAsyncOperation()
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
      } finally {
        setLoading(false)
      }
    }
    fetchData()
  }, [])

  return { data, loading }
}
```

Use:  
```tsx
function AsyncComponent() {
  const { data, loading } = useAsyncData()

  if (loading) return <div>loading...</div>
  if (!data) return <div>no data</div>
  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

There are also some libraries that can help us complete this process, such as react-query, swr, ahooks.

Using swr:
```tsx
function AsyncComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useSWR('key', fetcher)

  if (isLoading) return <div>loading...</div>
  if (!data) return <div>no data</div>
  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

## Conclusion
The core of React async is to understand that "React components are synchronous components".  
Components can maintain an asynchronous state internally, and when the asynchronous state is fulfilled, use `useState` to update the view.
