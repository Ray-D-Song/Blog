Last time I wrote an [UnoCSS icon selector](/zh-cn/blog/unocss-icon-viewer), hoping to create a library that can be used in both React and Vue.

The first thing that came to mind was Web Components. However, the drawback is that apart from the core logic, separate adaptation code needs to be written for Vue and React. For some smaller requirements, the cost of writing adaptation code may be higher than manual adaptation.

Then I discovered this weird thing called `Mitosis`. Mitosis, as the name suggests, can compile components into code for multiple frameworks, including React, Vue, Qwik, Solid, Angular, and Svelte.

The implementation principle is a compiler that compiles Mitosis files into a finite subset of Vue and React. Similar to UnoCSS, it is an exploration in the frontend compilation phase.

## Create Project
```bash
npm create @builder.io/mitosis@latest
```
When running the command, there will be some configurable options. When selecting the output target, only React, Svelte, and Qwik are available. However, it supports more frameworks than that. Modify the `targets` field in `library/mitosis.config.cjs` to add Vue support:
```js
"targets": [
  "react",
  "vue",
],
```
The project comes with two examples, `todo-app.lite.tsx` and `autocomplete.lite.tsx`. Try running them:
```bash
cd library
npm run build

# Mitosis: react: generated 2 components, 1 regular files.
# Mitosis: vue: generated 2 components, 1 regular files.
# Mitosis: generation completed.
```
React and Vue components will be generated in `/library/package`.

## Write Components
Mitosis components have a `.lite.tsx` suffix, similar to React's jsx syntax, but with its own API and restrictions.
```tsx
import { useState } from "@builder.io/mitosis";

export default function MyComponent(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Steve");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        css={{
          color: "red",
        }}
        value={name}
        onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)}
      />
      Hello! I can run natively in React, Vue, Svelte, Qwik, and many more frameworks!
    </div>
  );
}
```
For example, due to compiler restrictions, components only support the `export default function` syntax shown above and cannot be defined with `const` arrow functions and then exported.

### State Management
The most important thing in modern frontend frameworks is `state`.

#### useStore
State management in Mitosis components is done through the `useStore` hook, and the return value must be named `state` (another compiler restriction).
```tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  const state = useStore({
    iconList: [],
  })
}
```
In React components, `useStore` will be transformed into a simple `useState` definition.

You can pass anything as parameters to the store, but if the value you want requires expression calculation, you need to write a `getter`:
```tsx
const state = useStore({
  iconList: [],
  get outlineIcon() {
    return this.iconList.filter(icon => icon.endsWith('-outline'))
  },
})
```
The `getter` will be transformed into a separate method:
```tsx
const [iconList, setIconList] = useState(() => []);

function outlineIcon() {
  return iconList.filter((icon) => icon.endsWith("-outline"));
}
```

#### useState
Mitosis also supports the useState API, used the same way as in React:
```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
```
In Vue, both useState and useStore will be compiled into the `data` option in the options API.

> By the way, Mitosis currently does not support the `setup` syntax in Vue 3.

```ts
export default defineComponent({
  data() {
    return { count: 0 };
  },
})
```

### Styling
Mitosis allows writing `camelCase` styles using the `css` attribute on tags, and you can even write CSS queries like this.
```tsx
<div
  css={{
    marginTop: '10px',
    '@media (max-width: 500px)': {
      marginTop: '0px',
    },
  }}
/>
```
Moreover, the compiled result also isolates styles. (React itself still doesn't support this ðŸ˜‚)

Of course, you can also choose to use the `class` attribute (no need for `className` in React), but then style isolation won't be possible.

## Flow Control
To shield the differences between different frameworks, Mitosis implements its own flow control through a tag. Here is a comparison table, for more details refer to the [documentation](https://mitosis.builder.io/docs/components/):
| Mitosis | React | Vue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<Show>` | `if` | `v-if` |
| `<For>` | `map` | `v-for` |

## Integrating with Other Libraries
Since Mitosis is not a frontend framework but a compiler, it does not come with webpack or Vite integration out of the box.  
For example, if you want to use UnoCSS, you can only use the `uno cli` to watch file changes, compile the CSS files, and then import them.  

However, there is a better approach. Essentially, Mitosis is just a transformation pipeline, so all we need to do is set up the `output environment` of the artifacts. After Mitosis completes the transformation, other tools take over for bundling.  
The process of writing components then becomes:  
1. Write Mitosis components
2. Compile using `npm run build`, output to the Vite environment
3. Use a bundler like `Vite` to package the final artifacts for npm publishing

You can refer to this project as an example: [unocss-icon-viewer](https://github.com/Ray-D-Song/unocss-icon-viewer).  

There are some key points you may need to pay attention to, such as setting jsxImportSource to `@builder.io/mitosis` in the Mitosis tsconfig.  
This may cause jsx type errors when building libraries like React or Solid.  
The solution is to configure esbuild and ets plugins in Vite to dynamically modify compilerOptions.  
```ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ...
    dts({
      outDir: 'dist',
      include: 'packages/*/src/**',
      compilerOptions: {
        jsxImportSource: 'react',
      }
    }),
  ],
  // ...
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        jsxImportSource: 'react',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Drawbacks
Mitosis is a decent solution, but it also has its drawbacks, such as:
* Inability to control output quality, resulting code may not be optimal  
* Peculiar restrictions, like not allowing destructuring of props, only using `props.xxx`, indicating a weak compiler  
* The process of writing code => compiling to bundler environment => running test environment involves at least 3 watches and environments, making it overly complex
