Recently encountered a strange issue where an interface defined a type that met the requirements but couldn't be used as a generic parameter.  
```ts
type Foo = Record<string, unknown>

type Test<K extends Foo> = K

interface Bar {
  'a': string
}

/**
 * error:
 * Type 'Bar' does not satisfy the constraint 'Foo'.
 * Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'Bar'.
 */
type Res = Test<Bar>
```
TS indicates that the type Bar does not satisfy the definition of Foo, which is essentially an implicit index signature loss issue.  

## What is an Implicit Index Signature
`Implicit index signatures` are a feature of TypeScript that allows you to define an object type that can use any string as a key.  
This means you can create an object where the key names are dynamic, while the value types are uniform.  

For example
```ts
type Bar = {
  [key: string]: number
}
const bar: Bar = {
  'a': 1,
  'b': 2
}
```

## Solution
The issue of implicit index loss is limited to interfaces; types do not have this problem.  
In other words, for the initial example, modifying the definition of Bar to a type will resolve it:

```ts
type Foo = Record<string, unknown>

type Test<K extends Foo> = K

type Bar = { // [!code highlight]
  a: string
}

type Res = Test<Bar>
```
If you cannot easily modify your type, for instance, if it is a library type defined in node_modules, you can also use `Pick` to convert the interface to a type.
```ts
type Foo = Record<string, unknown>

type Test<K extends Foo> = K

interface Bar {
  a: string
}

type Res = Test<Pick<Bar, keyof Bar>> // [!code highlight]
```

This behavior of interfaces actually aligns with the expectations of the TypeScript team, and discussions on this were held as early as 2017.

The official explanation is:
"Interfaces can be enhanced through interface merging with the same name, while types cannot, so implicit index inference for types would be safer."
